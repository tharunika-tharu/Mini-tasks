      <h1>France</h1>
      <p>
        France, country of northwestern Europe. Historically and culturally
        among the most important nations in the Western world, France has also
        played a highly significant role in international affairs, with former
        colonies in every corner of the globe. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and
        the Mediterranean Sea, the Alps and the Pyrenees, France has long
        provided a geographic, economic, and linguistic bridge joining northern
        and southern Europe. It is Europe’s most important agricultural producer
        and one of the world’s leading industrial powers. France is among the
        globe’s oldest nations, the product of an alliance of duchies and
        principalities under a single ruler in the Middle Ages. Today, as in
        that era, central authority is vested in the state, even though a
        measure of autonomy has been granted to the country’s régions in recent
        decades. The French people look to the state as the primary guardian of
        liberty, and the state in turn provides a generous program of amenities
        for its citizens, from free education to health care and pension plans.

      <h1>Germany</h1>
      <p>
        Germany, country of north-central Europe, traversing the continent’s
        main physical divisions, from the outer ranges of the Alps northward
        across the varied landscape of the Central German Uplands and then
        across the North German Plain. Germany Germany One of Europe’s largest
        countries, Germany encompasses a wide variety of landscapes: the tall,
        sheer mountains of the south; the sandy, rolling plains of the north;
        the forested hills of the urbanized west; and the plains of the
        agricultural east. At the spiritual heart of the country is the
        magnificent east-central city of Berlin, which rose phoenixlike from the
        ashes of World War II and now, after decades of partition, is the
        capital of a reunified Germany, and the Rhine River, which flows
        northward from Switzerland and is celebrated in visual art, literature,
        folklore, and song. Along its banks and those of its principal
        tributaries—among them the Neckar, Main, Moselle, and Ruhr—stand
        hundreds of medieval castles, churches, picturesque villages, market
        towns, and centers of learning and culture, including Heidelberg, the
        site of one of Europe’s oldest universities (founded in 1386), and
        Mainz, historically one of Europe’s most important publishing centers.
        All are centerpieces of Germany’s thriving tourist economy, which brings
        millions of visitors to the country each year, drawn by its natural
        beauty, history, culture, and cuisine (including its renowned wines and
        beers).

      <h1>London</h1>
      <p>
        London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the oldest of
        the world’s great cities—its history spanning nearly two millennia—and
        one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s largest metropolis, it is
        also the country’s economic, transportation, and cultural center. Big
        Ben Big BenBig Ben, London. London is situated in southeastern England,
        lying astride the River Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its
        estuary on the North Sea. In satellite photographs the metropolis can be
        seen to sit compactly in a Green Belt of open land, with its principal
        ring highway (the M25 motorway) threaded around it at a radius of about
        20 miles (30 km) from the city center. The growth of the built-up area
        was halted by strict town planning controls in the mid-1950s. Its
        physical limits more or less correspond to the administrative and
        statistical boundaries separating the metropolitan county of Greater
        London from the “home counties” of Kent, Surrey, and Berkshire (in
        clockwise order) to the south of the river and Buckinghamshire,
        Hertfordshire, and Essex to the north.
